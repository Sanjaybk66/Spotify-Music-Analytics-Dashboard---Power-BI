# Spotify-Music-Analytics-Dashboard---Power-BI
# Description 
Developed an interactive Spotify Music Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze global music streaming data and uncover meaningful insights about track performance and artist popularity. The goal of this project was to transform raw streaming data into clear, visually engaging reports that help understand music trends and listener behavior.

The dashboard provides an overview of total streams and explores key audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, speechiness, and acousticness. These visualizations help identify patterns in song characteristics and how they relate to popularity. It also includes analysis of streams by release year, allowing users to observe how music trends have evolved over time.

Additional visuals highlight top-performing tracks, popular artists, and the distribution of songs across musical keys and modes. Interactive filters enable users to explore the dataset dynamically by artist name, release year, key, and mode, making the dashboard intuitive and user-friendly.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, visualization design, analytical thinking, and storytelling with data, showcasing the ability to convert complex datasets into actionable insights.
