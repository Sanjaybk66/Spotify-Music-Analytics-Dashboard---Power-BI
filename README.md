# Spotify-Music-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
# Description 
Developed an interactive Spotify Music Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze global music streaming data and uncover meaningful insights about track performance and artist popularity. The goal of this project was to transform raw streaming data into clear, visually engaging reports that help understand music trends and listener behavior.

The dashboard provides an overview of total streams and explores key audio features such as danceability, energy, valence, speechiness, and acousticness. These visualizations help identify patterns in song characteristics and how they relate to popularity. It also includes analysis of streams by release year, allowing users to observe how music trends have evolved over time.

Additional visuals highlight top-performing tracks, popular artists, and the distribution of songs across musical keys and modes. Interactive filters enable users to explore the dataset dynamically by artist name, release year, key, and mode, making the dashboard intuitive and user-friendly.

This project demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, visualization design, analytical thinking, and storytelling with data, showcasing the ability to convert complex datasets into actionable insights.
# Tools & Technologies Used
- Used Power BI Desktop as the primary tool for designing the dashboard layout, building data models, and configuring interactive visual elements to enhance storytelling and user engagement.

- Leveraged Power Query Editor to perform data transformation tasks such as handling missing values, formatting numerical and categorical fields, removing inconsistencies, and structuring the dataset for accurate visualization.

- Designed a variety of visualizations including bar charts for artist and track comparisons, line charts for streaming trends over time, scatter plots for analyzing audio feature relationships, and distribution charts for musical keys and modes.

- Implemented interactive slicers and filters to enable dynamic exploration of data by artist name, release year, key, and mode, making the dashboard intuitive and user-friendly.

- Applied structured data modeling techniques to ensure seamless interaction between visuals and maintain consistency across the dashboard.

Designed the dashboard with a modern dark-themed interface to create a visually appealing and professional user experience while maintaining clarity in data presentation.
